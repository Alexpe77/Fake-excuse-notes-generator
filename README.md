# Fake excuse notes generator

The goal of this exercise was to create a fake excuse note generator that offers pre-defined excuse notes to help parents get this done faster. </br>
Basically it's a form where you fill the name of your child the name of his professor and you also have radio boxes to chose the gender and the reason of your child's absence. </br>
From there my system will create a proper apology letter and for each reason there are 5 different excuses available so you can reuse it many times.
